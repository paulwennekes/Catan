# Catan in R 

This is the repository for the R code and other source items that are used to generate a random Catan Map. 
At the moment of this commit, the map generated is the simple Catan map basic version, with harbours and sea tiles not yet added. 
Please not that this is a very preliminary version, where I am just trying to get things to work and I am not concerned yet with optimisation, in terms of running speed or lines of code, and a lot of space could be saved by turning long lists of code into functions etc. 
Feel free to have a look at the code and play around with it, it's free for anyone to use, just credit me if you publish it anywhere.
In that same spirit of open collaboration: know that the images that I've used here were made by Ryan Schenk (https://github.com/rschenk), and taken from his photostream here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/ryanschenk/5167761311/
