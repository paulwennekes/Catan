# Catan in R 

# This is the repository for the R code and other source items that are used to generate a random Catan Map. 
# At the moment of this commit, the map generated is the simple Catan map basic version, with harbours and sea tiles not yet added. 
# Please not that this is a very preliminary version, where I am just trying to get things to work and I am not concerned yet with optimisation, 
# in terms of running speed or lines of code, and a lot of space could be saved by turning long lists of code into functions etc. 
# Feel free to have a look at the code and fiddle around with it, it's free for anyone to use as long as you include credit if you publish it anywhere.
